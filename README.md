# Deep-Learning-Homework
The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful. With my machine learning and neural networks knowledge, Iâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
To do so the following steps has been taken:
work has been performed on Google colab

Import our dependencies 

Import and read the charity_data.csv.

Drop the non-beneficial ID columns, 'EIN' and 'NAME'.

Determine the number of unique values in each column.

Look at APPLICATION_TYPE value counts for binning

Choose 500 as cutoff value and create a list of application types to be replaced

used the variable name `application_types_to_replace`

Look at CLASSIFICATION value counts for binning

Choose 200 as cutoff value and create a list of classifications to be replaced

use the variable name `classifications_to_replace`

Convert categorical data to numeric with `pd.get_dummies`

Split our preprocessed data into our features and target arrays

 Split the preprocessed data into a training and testing dataset

Create a StandardScaler instances

 Fit the StandardScale

 Scale the data

### Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model

Define the model - deep neural net, i.e., the number of input features and hidden nodes for each layer.

Define input layer, 2 Hidden layers and output layers

nn_model.build()

Check the structure of the model

Compile the model

Train the model

Evaluate the model using the test data

Export our model to HDF5 file
